8.1 Obtain the names of all physicians that have performed a medical procedure they have never been certified to perform.
SELECT Physician.Name 
FROM Physician
INNER JOIN Trained_In ON Physician.EmployeeID = Trained_In.Physician
INNER JOIN Undergoes ON Physician.EmployeeID = Undergoes.Physician
WHERE Trained_In.CertificationExpires < Undergoes.DateUndergoes

8.2 Same as the previous query, but include the following information in the results: Physician name, name of procedure, date when the procedure was carried out, name of the patient the procedure was carried out on.
SELECT Physician.Name, Procedures.Name, Undergoes.DateUndergoes, Trained_In.CertificationExpires, Patient.Name
FROM Undergoes
INNER JOIN Physician ON Undergoes.Physician = Physician.EmployeeID
INNER JOIN Patient ON Undergoes.Patient = Patient.SSN
INNER JOIN Procedures ON Undergoes.Procedures = Procedures.Code
INNER JOIN Trained_In ON Physician.EmployeeID = Trained_In.Physician
WHERE Trained_In.CertificationExpires < Undergoes.DateUndergoes

8.3 Obtain the names of all physicians that have performed a medical procedure that they are certified to perform, but such that the procedure was done at a date (Undergoes.Date) after the physician's certification expired (Trained_In.CertificationExpires).
SELECT Physician.Name 
FROM Physician
INNER JOIN Trained_In ON Physician.EmployeeID = Trained_In.Physician
INNER JOIN Undergoes ON Physician.EmployeeID = Undergoes.Physician
WHERE Trained_In.CertificationExpires < Undergoes.DateUndergoes

8.4 Same as the previous query, but include the following information in the results: Physician name, name of procedure, date when the procedure was carried out, name of the patient the procedure was carried out on, and date when the certification expired.
SELECT Physician.Name, Procedures.Name, Undergoes.DateUndergoes, Trained_In.CertificationExpires, Patient.Name
FROM Undergoes
INNER JOIN Physician ON Undergoes.Physician = Physician.EmployeeID
INNER JOIN Patient ON Undergoes.Patient = Patient.SSN
INNER JOIN Procedures ON Undergoes.Procedures = Procedures.Code
INNER JOIN Trained_In ON Physician.EmployeeID = Trained_In.Physician
WHERE Trained_In.CertificationExpires < Undergoes.DateUndergoes

8.5 Obtain the information for appointments where a patient met with a physician other than his/her primary care physician. Show the following information: Patient name, physician name, nurse name (if any), start and end time of appointment, examination room, and the name of the patient's primary care physician.
SELECT Pt.Name AS Patient, Ph.Name AS Physician, N.Name AS Nurse, A.Start, A.End, A.ExaminationRoom, PhPCP.Name AS PCP
  FROM Patient Pt, Physician Ph, Physician PhPCP, Appointment A 
  LEFT JOIN Nurse N 
  ON A.PrepNurse = N.EmployeeID
 WHERE A.Patient = Pt.SSN
   AND A.Physician = Ph.EmployeeID
   AND Pt.PCP = PhPCP.EmployeeID
   AND A.Physician <> Pt.PCP;

8.6 The Patient field in Undergoes is redundant, since we can obtain it from the Stay table. There are no constraints in force to prevent inconsistencies between these two tables. More specifically, the Undergoes table may include a row where the patient ID does not match the one we would obtain from the Stay table through the Undergoes.Stay foreign key. Select all rows from Undergoes that exhibit this inconsistency.
SELECT Undergoes.*, Stay.*
FROM Undergoes
INNER JOIN Stay ON Undergoes.Stay = Stay.StayID
WHERE Undergoes.Patient != Stay.Patient

8.7 Obtain the names of all the nurses who have ever been on call for room 123.
SELECT DISTINCT Nurse.Name
FROM On_Call
INNER JOIN Nurse ON On_Call.Nurse = Nurse.EmployeeID
INNER JOIN Block ON On_Call.BlockCode = Block.BlockCode
INNER JOIN Room ON Block.BlockCode = Room.BlockCode
WHERE Room.RoomNumber = 123

8.8 The hospital has several examination rooms where appointments take place. Obtain the number of appointments that have taken place in each examination room.
SELECT ExaminationRoom, COUNT(*) 
FROM Appointment
GROUP BY ExaminationRoom

8.9 Obtain the names of all patients (also include, for each patient, the name of the patient's primary care physician), such that \emph{all} the following are true:
    -- The patient has been prescribed some medication by his/her primary care physician.
    -- The patient has undergone a procedure with a cost larger that $5,000
    -- The patient has had at least two appointment where the nurse who prepped the appointment was a registered nurse.
    -- The patient's primary care physician is not the head of any department.
SELECT DISTINCT Patient.Name as Patient, Physician.Name as Doctor
FROM Patient
INNER JOIN Physician ON Patient.PCP = Physician.EmployeeID
INNER JOIN Prescribes ON Patient.SSN = Prescribes.Patient
INNER JOIN Undergoes ON Patient.SSN = Undergoes.Patient
INNER JOIN Procedures ON Undergoes.Procedures = Procedures.Code
LEFT JOIN Department ON Physician.EmployeeID = Department.Head
LEFT JOIN Appointment ON Patient.SSN = Appointment.Patient
WHERE Procedures.Cost > 5000
AND Physician.EmployeeID NOT IN (SELECT Department.Head FROM Department)
AND Appointment.PrepNurse IS NOT NULL
